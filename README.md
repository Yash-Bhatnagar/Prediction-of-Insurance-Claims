# Prediction-of-Insurance-Claims
Task: To Analyse the given data to predict whether an insurance claim made will be ‘accepted’ or ‘rejected’. 

Claim validation is a very crucial activity which consumes a lot of man-hours depending on the severity of a claim. In recent years there is an increase in the number of fraudulent claims. This takes a lot of quality time of the employees who are engaged in the claim verification process and sometimes leads to the delay in the Claim settlement of the actual cases.

This prediction can be used by the Claims Management team, as these models will provide them with the list of claims to be rejected in advance thus helping them to scrutinize the given claims and ensure no leakage in form of frauds based on historic data patterns.


This model was used in an online Hackathon and obtained an accuracy of: 0.949734

Note: The dataset consists of dummy values and have no relation to the real world!
